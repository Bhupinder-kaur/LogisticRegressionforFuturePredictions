# LogisticRegressionforFuturePredictions
Logistic Regression with Future Predictions
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a logistic regression model for binary classification and extends it to make future predictions using unseen data. The project includes standard data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and future predictions.

Features:
Data Loading: The project uses Pandas to load the dataset and select the relevant features.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.
Feature Scaling: Standardizes the input data using StandardScaler to improve the logistic regression model's performance.
Model Training: Fits a logistic regression model to the training data using Scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation:
Calculates and prints the confusion matrix and accuracy score for the test data.
Computes the training score (bias) and the testing score (variance) to assess overfitting or underfitting.
Generates a detailed classification report to understand model performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
Future Predictions:
Loads a separate dataset for future prediction.
Standardizes the future data and makes predictions using the trained model.
Appends the predictions to the dataset and exports it as a CSV file for further use.
Workflow:
Data Preprocessing: The input dataset is split into training and test sets, and feature scaling is applied to both.
Logistic Regression: A logistic regression model is trained on the scaled data.
Model Evaluation:
A confusion matrix is used to evaluate the classification performance.
Accuracy scores, bias, and variance are printed for performance assessment.
Classification Report: A comprehensive report is generated to provide insights into the model's precision, recall, F1-score, and support.
Future Predictions: The trained logistic regression model is applied to new data to predict outcomes, and the results are saved into a CSV file.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Update the paths to the datasets in the code as per your file structure.
Run the Python script to train the model and make predictions on future data.
The results of the future prediction will be saved in a CSV file (pred_model.csv).
Output:
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the model's performance on test data.
Accuracy Score: Gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing.
Bias and Variance: Helps in understanding model fit and generalization.
Classification Report: A detailed performance analysis for each class.
CSV File: Stores predictions made on the new dataset for future analysis.
